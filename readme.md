# Draft Pool App -- WIP
Draft Pool App used to draft NCAA Basketball tourney teams. Currently focused on Men's tourney

Sometimes referred to as a snake draft:
- 8 players
- Randomly select draft order (or use 40 times or whatever)
- First round selects 1 to 8
- Second round selects 8 to 1
- Third round selects 1 to 8
- and so on
